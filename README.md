# Depression Analysis: Prediction and Classification with Machine Learning  

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to analyse and classify depression symptoms. In the project, a classification model with high accuracy rates was created using various models and the model with the highest accuracy was optimised over a **pipeline**. The results show that effectively a model goes through the processes of data pre-processing, modelling and deployment.

**Project Summary**  
Depression is a serious public health problem worldwide. In this project, it is aimed to develop a tool for potentially early intervention by classifying depression symptoms. The following processes were completed by training machine learning models on the dataset:  

- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:** Completing missing values, labelling categorical variables and removing unnecessary columns.  
- **Machine Learning Modelling:** Model training and testing using various models.  
- **Pipeline and Hyperparameter Optimisation:** Creating a pipeline and optimising model parameters for process repeatability.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Examination of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores.  
- **Deployment:** Storing the model as a `.pkl` file and making it reusable.

**Conclusions and Implications**

This project demonstrates how machine learning can produce meaningful solutions to an important health problem such as depression. One of the most remarkable aspects of the project is that the test accuracy of the model has reached 97.2%.

With the pipeline and deployment processes, the model is ready for real-world applications. However, it should not be forgotten that only machine learning models should not be relied on in issues such as depression, and the results should be supported by expert evaluations.
